# MainFlow Task 6 - Time Series Forecasting & Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression)

This repository contains **Task 6** of the **Data Science Internship** at **Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this task is to perform analysis and prediction using two approaches:

- 📈 **Time Series Forecasting** on sales data to identify patterns and forecast future trends.
- ❤️ **Heart Disease Prediction** using **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical attributes.

The task involves data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, forecasting, evaluation, and visualization.
